# Comprehensive Estimation System - Wagner Coach Quick Entry

## Overview

Wagner Coach Quick Entry now provides **intelligent comprehensive estimation** for ALL log types, ensuring that every entry - no matter how vague - receives:

1. **Mandatory timestamps** with intelligent time inference
2. **Complete field estimates** for all relevant data (calories, duration, distance, etc.)
3. **Appropriate confidence levels** based on input specificity
4. **Actionable suggestions** for improving accuracy

## Philosophy

**Users should be able to log ANYTHING, ANYTIME, with ANY level of detail - and always get useful estimates.**

- Vague input: "ate chicken" ‚Üí Full nutritional estimate with assumed portions
- Time context: "morning run" ‚Üí Timestamp inferred as 7:00 AM today
- Minimal data: "chest workout" ‚Üí Typical exercises, duration, and calories estimated

The system NEVER returns null for core fields. It always provides best-guess estimates with appropriate confidence levels and guidance for improvement.

## üïê Timestamp Inference System

### Core Principle
**Every log MUST have a timestamp.** The AI infers time from context clues or uses current time as fallback.

### Time Inference Rules

#### Meal-Related Keywords
| User Input | Inferred Time | Field Name |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| "ate chicken" | Current time | `logged_at` |
| "had breakfast" | Today 7:30 AM | `logged_at` |
| "eggs for breakfast" | Today 7:30 AM | `logged_at` |
| "lunch was a burrito" | Today 12:30 PM | `logged_at` |
| "dinner last night" | Yesterday 6:30 PM | `logged_at` |
| "snack earlier" | 2 hours ago | `logged_at` |
| "pre-workout meal" | 1 hour ago | `logged_at` |
| "post-workout shake" | 30 minutes ago | `logged_at` |

#### Activity-Related Keywords
| User Input | Inferred Time | Field Name |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| "went for a run" | Current time or last hour | `start_date` |
| "morning run" | Today 7:00 AM | `start_date` |
| "ran after work" | Today 5:30 PM | `start_date` |
| "cycling yesterday" | Yesterday 3:00 PM | `start_date` |
| "evening walk" | Today 7:00 PM | `start_date` |

#### Workout-Related Keywords
| User Input | Inferred Time | Field Names |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| "bench pressed" | Current time | `started_at`, `completed_at` |
| "morning workout" | Today 7:00 AM | `started_at`, `completed_at` |
| "lifted after work" | Today 5:30 PM | `started_at`, `completed_at` |
| "leg day yesterday" | Yesterday 4:00 PM | `started_at`, `completed_at` |

#### Measurement Keywords
| User Input | Inferred Time | Field Name |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| "weighed myself" | Current time | `measured_at` |
| "morning weigh-in" | Today 7:00 AM | `measured_at` |

#### Meal Type Inference from Time
When time is known but meal type isn't specified:

- **6:00 AM - 10:00 AM** ‚Üí `breakfast`
- **11:00 AM - 2:00 PM** ‚Üí `lunch`
- **5:00 PM - 9:00 PM** ‚Üí `dinner`
- **All other times** ‚Üí `snack`
