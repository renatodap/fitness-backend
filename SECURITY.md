# Security Policy - Wagner Coach Backend

This document outlines security policies and best practices for the Wagner Coach backend.

---

## üîê Security Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens for API authentication
- ‚úÖ Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) for database access
- ‚úÖ Service role key only used server-side
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on all AI endpoints

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ All sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ Passwords never stored (Supabase Auth handles this)
- ‚úÖ API keys masked in logs
- ‚úÖ User data isolated by user_id (RLS policies)

### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ Pydantic models validate all API inputs
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevented (Supabase client uses parameterized queries)
- ‚úÖ XSS prevention (API returns JSON, not HTML)
- ‚úÖ File upload validation (size, type, content)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Security Checklist

### Before Deploying to Production

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] `DEBUG=false`
- [ ] `ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` set to specific frontend domain(s)
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` is strong (min 32 characters, generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- [ ] `CRON_SECRET` is unique (generated with `openssl rand -hex 16`)
- [ ] `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unique (generated with `openssl rand -hex 16`)
- [ ] All API keys are production keys (not test/dev keys)

#### API Configuration
- [ ] API docs disabled in production (`docs_url=None`)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (Railway/Fly.io handles this)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured on all AI endpoints
- [ ] CORS restricted to specific origins

#### Database
- [ ] Supabase RLS enabled on all tables
- [ ] Service role key never exposed to clients
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Connection pooling configured

#### Monitoring
- [ ] Sentry configured for error tracking
- [ ] Structured logging enabled
- [ ] Health check endpoint working (`/health`)
- [ ] API usage logs being written

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS Flag
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently enabled in development

**Risk**: Allows requests from any origin (CORS bypass)

**Mitigation**:
- MUST be set to `false` in production
- Backend logs warning when enabled
- `.env.example` includes deployment checklist

**Action Required**:
```bash
# In production .env
ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false
CORS_ORIGINS=https://wagnercoach.com,https://www.wagnercoach.com
```

### API Keys in Environment Variables
**Status**: ‚úÖ Properly handled

**Implementation**:
- All API keys loaded from environment variables
- Never hardcoded in source code
- Masked in logs and API responses
- `.env` file in `.gitignore`

### Rate Limiting
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO - Needs implementation

**Required For**:
- Coach chat endpoints (`/api/v1/coach/chat`)
- Quick entry endpoints (`/api/v1/quick-entry/*`)
- Program generation (`/api/v1/programs/generate`)

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# TODO: Add rate limiting middleware
# Target rates:
# - Coach chat: 100 messages/day per user
# - Quick entry: 200 entries/day per user
# - Program generation: 5 programs/month per user
```

## üîí Supabase RLS Policies

All database tables MUST have RLS enabled with appropriate policies.

### User Tables (profiles, user_preferences, etc.)
```sql
-- Users can only view/edit their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data"
ON table_name FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own data"
ON table_name FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Content Tables (meals, workouts, activities, etc.)
```sql
-- Users can only view/edit their own content
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own content"
ON table_name FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own content"
ON table_name FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own content"
ON table_name FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own content"
ON table_name FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Verify RLS
```bash
# Check all tables have RLS enabled
supabase db dump --schema public | grep "ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY"

# Should see output for every table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE meals ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
# etc.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è API Security Headers

### Required Headers (Handled by FastAPI/Railway)
```python
# HTTPS enforced by hosting platform
# Content-Security-Policy: handled by client
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (FastAPI default)
# X-Frame-Options: DENY (FastAPI default)
```

### CORS Configuration
```python
# Production settings
CORS_ORIGINS=https://wagnercoach.com
ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=false
```

---

## üîë Secrets Management

### Development
- Store in `.env` file (in `.gitignore`)
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Never commit `.env` to git

### Production (Railway/Fly.io)
- Set via platform dashboard (Railway Secrets / Fly Secrets)
- Never store in source code
- Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days)

### Secret Generation
```bash
# JWT Secret (32 bytes)
openssl rand -hex 32

# Other secrets (16 bytes)
openssl rand -hex 16

# Base64 secrets
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

### What to Log
- ‚úÖ API requests (without sensitive data)
- ‚úÖ Authentication events (success/failure)
- ‚úÖ AI API calls (model, tokens, cost)
- ‚úÖ Errors and exceptions
- ‚úÖ Database query errors

### What NOT to Log
- ‚ùå Passwords
- ‚ùå API keys
- ‚ùå JWT tokens
- ‚ùå User personal data (email, name) unless necessary
- ‚ùå Credit card info (if payment added)

### Sensitive Data Masking
```python
# Implemented in config.py
settings.model_dump()  # Automatically masks sensitive fields
# Output: {"OPENAI_API_KEY": "***REDACTED***", ...}
```

- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated
- ‚úÖ Use type hints (catch errors at dev time)

### For Deployment
- ‚úÖ Use production environment variables
- ‚úÖ Enable HTTPS (handled by Railway/Fly.io)

- ‚úÖ Enable Sentry for error tracking
- ‚úÖ Test security before deploying
- ‚úÖ Monitor logs after deployment
