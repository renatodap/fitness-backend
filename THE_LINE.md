# THE LINE - Baseline Estimation Rules

## Purpose
This document defines the **baseline estimation rules** for NEW users or when NO historical patterns exist.

These are the conservative defaults. Once we have user history, we use **PATTERN-BASED ESTIMATION** (see PATTERN_BASED_ESTIMATION.md).

---

## Core Principle

**Estimate what's calculable from standards. Never make up what's personal and highly variable.**

---

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS ESTIMATE (Baseline for New Users)

### 1. Timestamps
**Rule**: Every log needs a time.

| Input | Estimated Time |
|-------|---------------|
| "ate chicken" | Current time |
| "had breakfast" | Today 7:30 AM |
| "morning run" | Today 7:00 AM |
| "after work workout" | Today 5:30 PM |

### 2. Food Portions (When Food Named)
**Rule**: Use standard portions from nutritional databases.

| Input | Portion Estimate |
|-------|-----------------|
| "ate chicken" | 5oz grilled chicken breast |
| "had eggs" | 3 eggs |
| "protein shake" | 1 scoop (30g) |

### 3. Macros (Calculate from Portions)
**Rule**: Calculate from portion estimates.

- Chicken 5oz: 235 cal, 44g protein, 0g carbs, 5g fat
- 3 eggs: 216 cal, 18g protein, 1.2g carbs, 15g fat

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONALLY ESTIMATE (Only if Reasonable)

### 4. Activity Duration
**Rule**: Only for typical activities with known average durations.

| Input | Duration Estimate | Why |
|-------|------------------|-----|
| "morning run" | ~35 min | Typical recreational run |
| "workout" | ~50 min | Typical gym session |
| "walked dog" | ~20 min | Typical dog walk |

### 5. Calories
**Rule**: Only if you have duration (even estimated).

- Running 35min: ~350 cal (MET value √ó time)
- Strength training 50min: ~300 cal

### 6. RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
**Rule**: Only if effort keywords present.

| Keyword | RPE |
|---------|-----|
| "easy" | 4 |
| "moderate" | 6 |
| "hard" | 8 |
| "max effort" | 10 |

---

## ‚ùå NEVER ESTIMATE (Too Personal/Variable)

### 7. Distance
**Why**: Too variable (could be 1km or 20km).

- "went for a run" ‚Üí distance = null
- "morning run" ‚Üí distance = null

**Exception**: If user provides distance ("ran 5k"), use it.

### 8. Pace
**Why**: Requires both distance and time.

- Only calculate if BOTH distance and time known
- Otherwise: pace = null

### 9. Exercises Not Mentioned
**Why**: Presumptuous - user might have done different exercises.

- "chest workout" ‚Üí exercises = []
- "leg day" ‚Üí exercises = []

**Exception**: If user names exercise ("did bench press"), log it.

### 10. Sets/Reps/Weights
**Why**: Impossible to know without user input.

- Always null unless user specifies

### 11. Foods Not Mentioned
**Why**: Don't add sides user didn't mention.

- "ate chicken" ‚Üí only chicken, not rice/veggies

## üîÑ When to Use Baseline vs. Patterns

### NEW USERS (No History)
- Use this baseline (THE_LINE.md)
- Conservative estimates
- High `needs_clarification` rate

### RETURNING USERS (Has History)
- Use **PATTERN-BASED ESTIMATION** (see PATTERN_BASED_ESTIMATION.md)
- Smarter estimates from user's past logs
- Lower `needs_clarification` rate
- Higher confidence

---

## üö® Red Flags (Never Cross)

Even with patterns, NEVER:
1. ‚ùå Extrapolate wildly beyond user's typical behavior
2. ‚ùå Assume user always does the same thing
3. ‚ùå Ignore obvious changes in behavior
4. ‚ùå Make up data user has never logged before

---

## Summary

**THE_LINE for new users**:
- ‚úÖ Timestamps (always)
- ‚úÖ Food portions (when named)
- ‚úÖ Macros (calculable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Typical durations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calories from duration
- ‚ùå Distance, pace, exercises, sets/reps, extra foods

**For returning users**: See PATTERN_BASED_ESTIMATION.md
