## 🔄 HOW IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER

### **1. Generation Flow (With All Enhancements):**
```
User creates carousel
    ↓
System loads business profile
    ↓
System searches pgvector for similar successful examples
    ↓
System generates 10 hooks (with learned patterns + examples)
    ↓
DIVERSITY CHECK: Remove too-similar hooks (>60% similar)
    ↓
HEURISTIC SCORING: Rank remaining hooks (9 dimensions)
    ↓
User sees 7-8 truly different, high-quality hooks
    ↓
User rates hooks (1-5 stars) + provides feedback
    ↓
Learning service extracts features & patterns
    ↓
Patterns stored in learned_patterns table
    ↓
Embeddings saved to variant_embeddings (pgvector)
    ↓
REPEAT for outline, copywriting, visual stages
```

### **2. Learning Loop (Continuous Improvement):**
```
User publishes carousel to Instagram
    ↓
Wait 24-48 hours for metrics to stabilize
    ↓
User inputs save_rate, likes, comments, shares
    ↓
System calculates engagement score (save_rate / 3 * 5)
    ↓
System marks carousel as performed_well if save_rate > 3%
    ↓
System updates learned_patterns with new performance data
    ↓
System updates variant_embeddings with engagement scores
    ↓
Future generations prioritize high-performing patterns
    ↓
System gets smarter with each carousel ✅
```

### **3. Pattern Learning (What Gets Learned):**
```
HOOK PATTERNS:
- has_question: "Why is everyone...?" → 4.5/5 avg
- has_numbers: "7 tips..." → 82% success rate
- curiosity_gap: "The secret nobody..." → 4.3/5 avg
- pattern_interrupt: "Nobody talks about..." → 3.8% save rate

COPYWRITING PATTERNS:
- has_cta: Clear call-to-action → 4.3/5 avg
- tone_professional: Business audience → 73% success
- data_driven: Stats & numbers → 4.1/5 avg
- story_based: Narrative flow → 3.5% save rate

OUTLINE PATTERNS:
- structure_listicle: "7 ways..." → 4.0/5 avg
- structure_tutorial: "How to..." → 78% success
- structure_comparison: "X vs Y" → 3.2% save rate
```
