# User Journey: Learning System in Action

**This document shows the EXACT user experience with all 5 phases working together.**

---

## Step-by-Step User Flow

### 1. User Creates a Carousel

**User Action:**
```
User clicks "Create New Carousel" button
Enters topic: "10 AI Tools That Changed My Workflow"
```

**System Response (Phase 5 - OpenRouter):**
- ✅ All AI calls route through OpenRouter
- ✅ Research uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet ($3/$15)
- ✅ Copywriting uses Claude 3.5 Haiku ($1/$5) - 67% cheaper!
- ✅ Auto-fallback if rate limits hit

---

### 2. System Generates Research Variants

**System Action (Phase 3 - Diversity Enforcement):**
```
Generating 3 diverse research approaches...

Variant 1: Comprehensive (Reddit + Twitter + deep facts)
Variant 2: Focused (core concepts only)
Variant 3: Visual-first (emphasis on visual opportunities)

✅ Diversity check: Cosine similarity < 70%
✅ All variants sufficiently different
```

**User Sees:**
- 3 distinct research options
- Each with different strategies
- No "fake choices" - genuinely diverse

---

### 3. System Shows Variants with Scores

**System Action (Phase 2 - Heuristic Scoring):**
```
Analyzing variants...

Variant 1: 8.5/10 (Comprehensive, high engagement potential)
Variant 2: 7.8/10 (Focused, good clarity)
Variant 3: 8.2/10 (Visual-first, strong specificity)

Top recommendation: Variant 1
```

**User Sees:**
- Green trending-up icon with score
- Breakdown: Clarity 8.5, Engagement 9.0, Readability 8.2
- Variants auto-sorted by score

---

### 4. System Injects Past Successes

**System Action (Phase 4 - pgvector Semantic Search):**
```
Searching for similar successful content...

Found 3 past carousels with:
- Similar topic (AI productivity)
- High engagement (save_rate > 3%)
- High user ratings (4-5 stars)

Injecting examples into generation prompt...

Example 1: "These AI tools saved me 10 hours/week" (save_rate: 4.2%)
Example 2: "AI workflow automation stack" (save_rate: 3.8%)
Example 3: "My AI productivity system" (save_rate: 3.5%)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Next generation learns from past wins
- ✅ Better quality from the start
- ✅ Matches user's successful patterns

---

### 5. User Reviews and Rates Variants

**User Action:**
```
[Variant 1 Card]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Option 1                 📈 8.5/10

Preview:
"10 AI Tools That 10x'd My Productivity"

Key Facts: 12
Sources: 8
Visual Opportunities: 5

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Rate this variant:          │
│ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (User clicks 5)    │
│                             │
│ Optional feedback:          │
│ "Perfect! Exactly what I    │
│  wanted - comprehensive"    │
│                             │
│ [Submit Rating] ✓ Saved     │
└─────────────────────────────┘

[Approve This Option] ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**System Action (Phase 1 - User Scoring):**
```sql
INSERT INTO user_variant_scores (
  user_id, variant_id, carousel_id,
  user_score: 5.0,
  user_feedback: "Perfect! Exactly what I wanted - comprehensive",
  selected: true
) ✅

Learning from rating...
Pattern identified: User prefers comprehensive research
Updating learned_patterns table... ✅
```

---

### 6. Pattern Learning Happens

**System Action (Phase 1 - Pattern Tracking):**
```
Analyzing variant features...

Extracted patterns:
- has_reddit_data: true
- has_twitter_data: true
- fact_count: 12 (high)
- source_diversity: high
- visual_count: 5

Updating learned_patterns:
- Pattern: "comprehensive_research"
- avg_user_score: 4.8 (↑ from 4.5)
- usage_count: 15 (↑ from 14)
- confidence_level: 0.85 (high)

Next carousel will prioritize comprehensive approach! ✅
```

---

### 7. Embedding Generated for Future Search

**System Action (Phase 4 - pgvector):**
```python
# Generate embedding
embedding = await openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input="10 AI Tools That 10x'd My Productivity..."
)

# Store in database
INSERT INTO variant_embeddings (
    variant_id, carousel_id,
    embedding: [0.023, -0.041, ...],  # 1536 dimensions
    user_score: 5.0,
    selected: true,
    performed_well: null  # Will be updated after Instagram metrics
) ✅
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Future searches can find this high-rated variant
- ✅ Similar tasks will benefit from this success
- ✅ System builds knowledge base over time

---

### 8. User Publishes to Instagram

**User Action:**
```
Carousel complete!
Publishing to Instagram...
```

**System Tracks (Phase 1 - Engagement Feedback):**
```
After 48 hours:
- Reach: 5,240 accounts
- Saves: 198 (save_rate: 3.8%)
- Engagement score: 5.0/5 (excellent!)

Updating user_variant_scores:
- engagement_score: 5.0
- performed_well: true
- combined_reward: 5.0 (user_score * 0.4 + engagement * 0.6)

Updating learned_patterns:
- "comprehensive_research" avg_engagement: 4.5 ✅
- success_rate: 82% (↑ from 78%)

Updating variant_embeddings:
- performed_well: true ✅
```

---

### 9. Next Carousel Generation (Learning Applied)

**User Creates Second Carousel:**
```
Topic: "5 Notion Hacks for Productivity"
```

**System Now Knows (All Phases Working Together):**
```
🧠 Learned from past ratings:
- User prefers comprehensive research (avg_score: 4.8)
- User likes high fact counts (12+ facts)
- User values source diversity (Reddit + Twitter)

🔍 Semantic search finds similar successful content:
- "10 AI Tools..." (save_rate: 3.8%) ← Previous carousel!
- "Productivity system breakdown" (save_rate: 4.1%)

💰 Cost optimization via OpenRouter:
- Research: Claude 3.5 Sonnet ($3/$15) - Complex task
- Copywriting: Claude 3.5 Haiku ($1/$5) - Standard task
- Total: ~$2.50 instead of ~$5.00 (50% savings!)

🎨 Generating variants:
Variant 1: Comprehensive approach (PRIORITIZED based on learning!)
  - Heuristic score: 8.7/10 (↑ from typical 8.0)
  - Injected examples from past successes
  - Diverse from other variants (72% similarity)

Variant 2: Focused approach
  - Heuristic score: 7.9/10
  - Different strategy

Variant 3: Visual-first approach
  - Heuristic score: 8.1/10
  - Emphasis on design
```

**Result:**
- ✅ **Higher quality variants from the start**
- ✅ **Personalized to user's preferences**
- ✅ **Learning from past successes**
- ✅ **50% cost savings**
- ✅ **Genuinely diverse options**
