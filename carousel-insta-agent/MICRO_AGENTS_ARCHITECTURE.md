## The 3 Micro-Agents

### 1. Research Quality Agent üîç

**Purpose**: Ensures research meets quality standards before proceeding
**Location**: `backend/app/agents/research_agent.py`

**Decision Logic**:
```python
if research_quality < 7.0:
    conduct_deep_research()  # Additional sources, enhanced queries
else:
    proceed_with_initial_research()
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Prevents low-quality content from being generated
- ‚úÖ Automatically identifies topics needing deeper research
- ‚úÖ Cost increase: 10-15% (only when deep research needed)

**Metrics**:
```
Deep research triggered: ~30% of carousels
Average quality improvement: 6.5 ‚Üí 8.2 (when triggered)
Additional cost: ~$0.20 per deep research
```

---

### 2. Adaptive Copywriting Agent ‚úçÔ∏è

**Purpose**: Generates slide copy with iterative quality improvement
**Location**: `backend/app/agents/copywriting_agent.py`

**Quality Loop**:
```python
for iteration in range(1, max_iterations + 1):
    slide_copy = generate_copy(slide_spec)
    quality_score = evaluate_quality(slide_copy)

    if quality_score >= 8.0:
        return slide_copy  # Success!
    else:
        # Retry with improvement feedback
        slide_spec["feedback"] = evaluation_feedback
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic quality assurance (no manual regeneration)
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality scores >8.0/10
- ‚úÖ Cost increase: 15-20% (1.5√ó attempts on average)

**Metrics**:
```
Success on first attempt: ~60%
Success on second attempt: ~35%
Success on third attempt: ~5%
Max iterations: 3 (prevents infinite loops)
Average quality score: 8.4/10 (vs 7.2/10 without agent)
```

---

### 3. Hook Optimization Agent üé£

**Purpose**: Optimizes first slide hook for maximum engagement
**Location**: `backend/app/agents/hook_agent.py`

**Optimization Flow**:
```python
variations = generate_hook_variations(topic, original_hook)  # 10 variations
ranked = evaluate_and_rank(variations)  # Predict engagement
best = select_best(ranked, original_hook)  # Auto-select or keep original
```

**Hook Patterns Used**:
1. Pattern interrupt: "Nobody talks about..."
2. Curiosity gap: "The AI feature everyone's sleeping on"
3. Bold claim: "This is better than ChatGPT Pro"
4. FOMO: "If you're not using this, you're behind"
5. Contrarian: "Stop using AI like this"
6. Direct benefit: "Save 10 hours/week with this trick"
7. Question: "Why is everyone switching to X?"
8. List/Number: "7 AI tools you didn't know existed"
9. How-to: "How to 10x your productivity with AI"
10. Shock/Surprise: "ChatGPT can't do this (but this can)"

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ 10 hook variations evaluated and ranked
- ‚úÖ Automatic selection of best performer
- ‚úÖ Predicted engagement scores guide decision
- ‚úÖ Cost increase: ~$0.40 per carousel

**Metrics**:
```
Optimized hook selected: ~70% of carousels
Average predicted score improvement: +1.2 points
Keeps original: ~30% (when original scores well)
```

## Base Infrastructure

### BaseAgent Class
**Location**: `backend/app/agents/base.py`

Provides common functionality for all agents:
- LLM interaction with cost tracking
- Iteration counting
- Metrics reporting
- Error handling

**Example Usage**:
```python
class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="my_agent")

    async def execute(self, **kwargs):
        response = await self._call_claude(
            prompt="...",
            max_tokens=1000
        )

        metrics = self.get_metrics()
        # {"agent": "my_agent", "total_cost": 0.15, "iterations": 3}

        return {"result": response["content"]}
```

---

### QualityEvaluator
**Location**: `backend/app/agents/evaluator.py`

Standardized quality evaluation for:
- **Slide copy** (4 criteria: clarity, engagement, brand alignment, readability)
- **Research** (4 criteria: depth, relevance, recency, visual potential)
- **Hooks** (ranking by predicted engagement)

**Example Usage**:
```python
evaluator = QualityEvaluator()

# Evaluate slide copy
evaluation = await evaluator.evaluate_slide_copy(
    slide_copy={"headline": "...", "body_text": "..."},
    target_audience="AI enthusiasts",
    brand_voice="educational_engaging"
)
# Returns: {overall_score: 8.5, clarity_score: 9.0, ...}

# Rank hooks
ranked = await evaluator.rank_hook_variations(
    variations=[{"hook": "...", "pattern": "curiosity_gap"}, ...],
    topic="RAG systems",
    target_audience="developers"
)
# Returns: sorted list by predicted_score
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Enable/disable micro-agents (backward compatible)
AGENT_ENABLED=true

# Copywriting Agent
COPYWRITING_AGENT_MIN_QUALITY=8.0
COPYWRITING_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=3

# Research Agent
RESEARCH_AGENT_MIN_QUALITY=7.0

## Integration

### Carousel Service Integration
**Location**: `backend/app/services/carousel_service.py`

Agents are initialized conditionally:
```python
class CarouselService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = SupabaseService()
        self.research = ResearchService()
        self.content = ContentService()

        # Initialize micro-agents (only if enabled)
        if settings.AGENT_ENABLED:
            self.research_agent = ResearchAgent()
            self.copywriting_agent = CopywritingAgent()
            self.hook_agent = HookAgent()
```

**Integration Points**:

1. **After initial research** (line ~183):
```python
if settings.AGENT_ENABLED and self.research_agent:
    research_result = await self.research_agent.execute_with_adaptive_depth(
        topic=carousel["topic"],
        initial_research=initial_research,
    )
    research_data = research_result["research_data"]
```

2. **During copywriting** (line ~262):
```python
if settings.AGENT_ENABLED and self.copywriting_agent:
    copywriting_result = await self.copywriting_agent.generate_all_slides_with_quality_check(
        outline=outline["outline"],
        brand_voice=carousel["brand_voice"],
        target_audience=carousel["target_audience"],
    )
    slides_copy = copywriting_result["slides"]
```

3. **Hook optimization** (line ~301):
```python
if settings.AGENT_ENABLED and self.hook_agent:
    hook_result = await self.hook_agent.optimize_hook(
        topic=carousel["topic"],
        original_hook=original_hook,
        target_audience=carousel["target_audience"],
    )
    if hook_result["used_optimized"]:
        slides_copy["slides"][0]["headline"] = hook_result["best_hook"]
```

## Logging & Observability

### Structured Logs

Agents emit detailed structured logs:

```python
# Research Agent
logger.info(
    "research_agent_complete",
    deep_research_conducted=True,
    quality_score=8.2,
    total_cost=0.50
)

# Copywriting Agent
logger.info(
    "copywriting_agent_complete",
    slide_count=8,
    avg_quality=8.4,
    total_attempts=12,  # 1.5 per slide
    total_cost=0.95
)

# Hook Agent
logger.info(
    "hook_optimized",
    original_hook="How RAG works in AI",
    optimized_hook="The RAG feature everyone's sleeping on",
    predicted_score=9.2
)
```

### Metrics Dashboard

Track agent performance:
- Quality scores over time
- Retry rates per agent
- Cost per carousel
- Agent usage percentage
- Quality vs. cost tradeoff

**Example Query** (for observability tools):
```sql
SELECT
    DATE(timestamp) as date,
    AVG(avg_quality) as avg_quality,
    AVG(total_cost) as avg_cost,
    SUM(deep_research_conducted) / COUNT(*) as deep_research_rate
FROM carousel_logs
WHERE agent_enabled = true
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Carousel with Agents Enabled

```python
from app.services.carousel_service import CarouselService

service = CarouselService()

# Create carousel
carousel_id = await service.create_carousel(
    user_id="user-123",
    topic="How vector embeddings work in AI",
    carousel_type="explainer",
    slide_count=8,
    target_audience="AI enthusiasts",
    brand_voice="educational_engaging"
)

# Generate (agents run automatically if AGENT_ENABLED=true)
await service.generate_carousel_async(
    carousel_id=carousel_id,
    user_id="user-123",
    auto_publish=False,
    generate_variants=True
)

# Result:
# - Research quality checked (may trigger deep research)
# - Each slide copy quality-checked (retries if < 8.0)
# - Hook optimized (10 variations generated and evaluated)
# - Total cost: ~$3.09
# - Total time: ~8.5 minutes
# - Quality: 8.5/10 average
```

### Example 2: Disable Agents (Traditional Flow)

```bash
# .env
AGENT_ENABLED=false
```

```python
# Same code, but agents are bypassed
# Result:
# - Traditional research (no quality check)
# - Traditional copywriting (no retries)
# - No hook optimization
# - Total cost: ~$2.55
# - Total time: ~7.2 minutes
# - Quality: 7.2/10 average
```

### Example 3: Adjust Quality Thresholds

```bash
# .env
COPYWRITING_AGENT_MIN_QUALITY=9.0  # Higher quality bar
COPYWRITING_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=5  # More retries allowed
```

Result: Higher quality (8.8/10 avg) but higher cost ($3.50) and time (10 min)

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Tests are located in `backend/tests/unit/test_*_agent.py`:

**Run all agent tests**:
```bash
poetry run pytest backend/tests/unit/test_*_agent.py -v
```

**Test Coverage**:
- Copywriting Agent: 10 tests
- Research Agent: 10 tests
- Hook Agent: 10 tests
- Total: 30 tests

**Example Test**:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_copywriting_agent_quality_loop():
    """Test that agent retries when quality is below threshold."""
    agent = CopywritingAgent()

    result = await agent.generate_with_quality_check(
        slide_spec={"slide_number": 1, "key_message": "Test"},
        brand_voice="professional",
        target_audience="developers"
    )

    assert result["quality_score"] >= 8.0  # Min threshold
    assert result["attempts"] <= 3  # Max iterations
    assert result["success"] is True
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Costs Too High

**Symptoms**: Carousels consistently cost >$4.00

**Solutions**:
1. Lower quality thresholds:
   ```bash
   COPYWRITING_AGENT_MIN_QUALITY=7.5
   RESEARCH_AGENT_MIN_QUALITY=6.5
   ```

2. Reduce max iterations:
   ```bash
   COPYWRITING_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=2
   ```

3. Disable specific agents:
   ```python
   # In carousel_service.py
   if settings.AGENT_ENABLED and False:  # Temporarily disable
       await self.research_agent.execute(...)
   ```

### Issue: Generation Takes Too Long

**Symptoms**: Carousels take >15 minutes

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce hook variations:
   ```bash
   HOOK_AGENT_NUM_VARIATIONS=5
   ```

2. Lower quality bars (faster convergence)

3. Check for stuck quality loops (logs show many retries)

### Issue: Quality Not Improving

**Symptoms**: Quality scores still ~7.0 with agents enabled

**Solutions**:
1. Verify agents are actually running:
   ```bash
   # Check logs for:
   grep "using_research_agent" carousel.log
   grep "using_copywriting_agent" carousel.log
   grep "using_hook_agent" carousel.log
   ```

2. Check evaluation prompts (may need tuning)

3. Increase max iterations for more attempts

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use only specific agents?
A: Yes! Edit `carousel_service.py` and conditionally disable agents:
```python
if settings.AGENT_ENABLED and self.research_agent and False:
    # Research agent disabled
```

### Q: How do I monitor agent performance?
A: Use structured logs:
```bash
grep "agent_complete" carousel.log | jq '.avg_quality'
```

### Q: What if an agent fails?
A: Agents have fallback behavior:
- Research Agent: Uses initial research
- Copywriting Agent: Returns best attempt (even if below threshold)
- Hook Agent: Keeps original hook

### Q: Can agents run in parallel?
A: No, they run sequentially by design (each depends on previous step output).

### Q: How do I tune agent parameters?
A: Adjust environment variables in `.env`, then restart the service.
