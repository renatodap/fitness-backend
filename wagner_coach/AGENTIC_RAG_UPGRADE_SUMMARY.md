# Agentic RAG Upgrade for Wagner Coach - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified

The unified AI coach was **NOT accessing critical user information**:
- ❌ User profile (age, weight, goals, dietary preferences)
- ❌ Meal logs from `meal_logs` table
- ❌ Activity logs from `activities` table
- ❌ Workout/nutrition programs
- ❌ Body measurements

### Root Cause
The coach's RAG system (`unified_coach_service.py`) was **only searching `quick_entry_embeddings` table**, which meant:
- Only data entered via Quick Entry was available
- No access to directly logged meals, activities, or user profile
- No structured program data
- Limited context for personalized responses

## Solution Implemented

Created a **production-level Agentic RAG architecture** with intelligent query analysis and multi-source retrieval.

## Implementation Details

### New File: `app/services/agentic_rag_service.py`

**Key Features:**

1. **Query Analysis Agent**
   - Intent classification (nutrition, training, measurement, general)
   - Temporal scope detection (recent vs historical)
   - Data source prioritization
   - Confidence scoring

2. **Multi-Source Retrieval Agent**
   - Profile data retrieval (ALWAYS included for personalization)
   - Meal logs from `meal_logs` table
   - Activity logs from `activities` table
   - Active programs (nutrition/workout)
   - Body measurements
   - Semantic search on quick_entry_embeddings
   - Conversation history

3. **Context Assembly Agent**
   - Formats data hierarchically
   - Prioritizes based on query intent
   - Applies token limits (default 3000 tokens / ~12,000 chars)
   - Structured output optimized for Claude

### Updated File: `app/services/unified_coach_service.py`

**Changes:**
- Added import: `from app.services.agentic_rag_service import get_agentic_rag_service`
- Added service instance: `self.agentic_rag = get_agentic_rag_service()`
- Replaced old `_build_rag_context()` method with agentic RAG service call
- Enhanced logging to show sources used and retrieval stats

**Old Code:**
```python
rag_context = await self._build_rag_context(user_id, message)
```

**New Code:**
```python
rag_result = await self.agentic_rag.build_context(
    user_id=user_id,
    query=message,
    max_tokens=3000,
    include_conversation_history=True
)
rag_context = rag_result["context_string"]
logger.info(
    f"[UnifiedCoach._handle_chat_mode] RAG context built: {len(rag_context)} chars, "
    f"sources: {rag_result['sources_used']}, stats: {rag_result['stats']}"
)
```

## Agentic RAG Patterns Implemented

Based on the user's requirements, we implemented:

### 1. Message Classification & Contextual Awareness ✅
- **Query Analysis Agent** classifies intent into:
  - Nutrition (meal-related queries)
  - Training (workout-related queries)
  - Measurement (body metrics)
  - General (catch-all)
- Determines which data sources are relevant
- Evaluates temporal scope (recent vs historical)

### 2. Multi-Source Data Integration ✅
- **Profile**: Always included (name, age, weight, goals, dietary preferences)
- **Nutrition API**: Meal logs from `meal_logs` table
- **Activity API**: Workout logs from `activities` table
- **Programs**: Active nutrition/workout programs
- **Measurements**: Body measurements for progress tracking
- **RAG**: Semantic search across quick_entry_embeddings
- **Conversation**: Recent chat history for continuity

### 3. Tool Calling Decision Tree ✅
- **Simple Queries**: Direct data retrieval (profile, recent meals)
- **Complex Queries**: Multi-step retrieval + semantic search + context assembly
- **Adaptive Workflow**: Switches between structured data and RAG based on query complexity

### 4. Safety & Governance Controls ✅
- **Nutritional Guardrails**: Retrieves user's dietary preferences and restrictions
- **Data Privacy**: Row-level security enforced (all queries filtered by `user_id`)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if any source fails
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of sources used and stats

## Data Flow Example

**User Query:** "What should I eat for breakfast?"

### Step 1: Query Analysis
```python
{
    "intent": "nutrition",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "temporal_scope": "recent",
    "data_sources_needed": ["profile", "meals", "nutrition_program", "quick_entry"]
}
```

### Step 2: Multi-Source Retrieval
```python
sources_retrieved = {
    "profile": {
        "age": 28,
        "weight_kg": 75,
        "primary_goal": "muscle_gain",
        "dietary_preferences": "high_protein"
    },
    "nutrition_program": {
        "target_calories": 2800,
        "target_protein_grams": 180
    },
    "meals": [
        {"logged_at": "2025-10-07T08:00", "description": "3 eggs + oatmeal", "calories": 450, "protein_g": 35},
        {"logged_at": "2025-10-06T08:00", "description": "Greek yogurt bowl", "calories": 380, "protein_g": 32}
    ],
    "quick_entry_rag": [
        {"similarity": 0.85, "content": "Breakfast: protein pancakes with berries"},
        {"similarity": 0.78, "content": "Post-workout meal: chicken breast with rice"}
    ]
}
```

### Step 3: Context Assembly
```
=== USER PROFILE ===
Name: John Doe
Age: 28
Weight: 75 kg
Primary Goal: muscle_gain
Dietary Preferences: high_protein

=== ACTIVE PROGRAMS ===
[NUTRITION PROGRAM]
Target Calories: 2800
Target Protein: 180g

=== RECENT MEALS ===
- 2025-10-07T08:00: 3 eggs + oatmeal (450 cal, 35g protein)
- 2025-10-06T08:00: Greek yogurt bowl (380 cal, 32g protein)

=== RELEVANT HISTORY (Semantic Search) ===
1. [MEAL] (2d ago) [similarity: 0.85]
   Breakfast: protein pancakes with berries
2. [MEAL] (5d ago) [similarity: 0.78]
   Post-workout meal: chicken breast with rice
```

### Result: Personalized Response
Claude now has **complete context** to provide a highly personalized breakfast recommendation:
- Knows user's goal (muscle gain)
- Knows dietary preference (high protein)
- Knows daily targets (2800 cal, 180g protein)
- Sees recent breakfast patterns
- Has semantic understanding of user's food preferences

## Benefits of Agentic RAG

### 1. **Comprehensive Context** 🎯
- Coach now accesses **ALL** user data, not just quick entries
- Profile-aware responses (personalized by age, goals, preferences)
- Program-aligned recommendations (respects nutrition/workout targets)

### 2. **Intent-Aware Retrieval** 🧠
- Nutrition queries prioritize meal logs and nutrition program
- Training queries prioritize activity logs and workout program
- Measurement queries prioritize body measurements

### 3. **Improved User Experience** 🚀
- More relevant and specific responses
- References actual user data (e.g., "Based on your 3 meals yesterday...")
- Consistent with user's goals and preferences

### 4. **Production-Ready** ✅
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Token limits to control costs
- Row-level security enforced

### 5. **Scalable Architecture** 📈
- Easy to add new data sources
- Simple to adjust intent classification rules
- Modular design (each agent is independent)

## Cost Considerations

The agentic RAG service is **cost-efficient**:
- Uses FREE embeddings (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Only increases context size (input tokens to Claude)
- Claude prompt caching reduces costs by 90% on cached portions
- Target: $0.30/user/month for coach chat (unchanged)

**Example cost calculation:**
- Profile retrieval: FREE (database query)
- Meal/activity retrieval: FREE (database query)
- Semantic search: FREE (pgvector + local embeddings)
- Claude input tokens: ~2000 tokens (profile + meals + RAG) = $0.006
- Claude output tokens: ~300 tokens (response) = $0.0045
- **Total per chat**: ~$0.01 (within budget)

## Testing & Validation

### Recommended Testing Steps

1. **Test Profile Retrieval**
   - Send query: "What's my goal?"
   - Verify coach mentions user's `primary_goal` from profile

2. **Test Meal Context**
   - Send query: "What did I eat yesterday?"
   - Verify coach references actual meals from `meal_logs`

3. **Test Activity Context**
   - Send query: "What workouts did I do this week?"
   - Verify coach references actual workouts from `activities`

4. **Test Program Alignment**
   - Send query: "Am I hitting my protein target?"
   - Verify coach references `nutrition_program` target and compares to recent meals

5. **Test Intent Classification**
   - Nutrition query: "What should I eat for dinner?"
   - Training query: "What workout should I do today?"
   - General query: "How am I doing overall?"
   - Verify appropriate sources are used for each

### Example Test Queries

```bash
# Nutrition query (should retrieve: profile, meals, nutrition_program, RAG)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/coach/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_JWT>" \
