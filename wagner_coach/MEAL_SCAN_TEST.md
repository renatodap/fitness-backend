# Meal Scan Flow - Verification Checklist

## Flow Overview
1. ✅ Take photo or upload from gallery
2. ✅ AI analyzes image (OpenAI Vision)
3. ✅ Detects foods → Matches to database
4. ✅ Redirects to /nutrition/log with pre-filled data
5. ✅ User reviews/edits → Saves

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Step 1: Photo Capture/Upload
**Files:**
- `app/meal-scan/page.tsx` - Server component with auth check
- `components/MealScan/MealScanClient.tsx` - Client component with camera/upload

**Features:**
- ✅ Camera capture button with `capture="environment"` for mobile rear camera
- ✅ Gallery upload button
- ✅ File validation (max 10MB, image/* types)
- ✅ Image preview before analysis
- ✅ Responsive UI (mobile & desktop)
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback

**Mobile Compatibility:**
```tsx
// Line 238-244 in MealScanClient.tsx
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  capture="environment"  // ✅ Uses rear camera on mobile
  className="hidden"
  onChange={(e) => handleFileSelect(e.target.files)}
/>
```

### ✅ Step 2: AI Analysis
**Files:**
- `lib/services/client-image-analysis.ts` - OpenAI Vision API wrapper
- Backend: Unified coach service

**Process:**
1. ✅ Image sent to OpenAI Vision API (client-side)
2. ✅ Formatted analysis sent to unified coach backend
3. ✅ Backend returns `food_detected` chunk with structured data

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  food_detected: {
    is_food: boolean
    meal_type: 'breakfast' | 'lunch' | 'dinner' | 'snack'
    description: string
    food_items: [
      {
        name: string
        quantity: string
        unit: string
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Food Matching
**Files:**
- `lib/api/foods.ts` - Frontend API client
- Backend: `app/api/v1/foods.py` - `/foods/match-detected` endpoint
- Backend: `app/services/food_search_service.py` - Matching logic

**Process:**
1. ✅ Detected foods sent to `/api/v1/foods/match-detected`
2. ✅ Backend searches database using fuzzy matching
3. ✅ Returns matched foods with full nutrition data
4. ✅ Returns unmatched foods list

**Matching Logic:**
```python
# Backend uses:
- Exact name match
- Fuzzy search (trigram similarity)
- Brand name matching
- Returns best match per detected food
```

### ✅ Step 4: Redirect to Log Page
**Files:**
- `components/MealScan/MealScanClient.tsx` - Redirect logic (lines 145-154)
- `app/nutrition/log/page.tsx` - Receives and parses previewData

**URL Parameters:**
```typescript
/nutrition/log?previewData={...}&returnTo=/meal-scan&conversationId=...&userMessageId=...
```

**PreviewData Structure:**
```typescript
{
  meal_type: 'breakfast' | 'lunch' | 'dinner' | 'snack',
  notes: string,  // Includes detected foods and description
  foods: [
    {
      food_id: string,
      name: string,
      brand: string | null,
      quantity: number,
      unit: string,
      serving_size: number,
      serving_unit: string,
      calories: number,
      protein_g: number,
      carbs_g: number,
      fat_g: number,
      fiber_g: number
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Step 5: Review & Save
**Files:**
- `app/nutrition/log/page.tsx` - Main log form
- `components/nutrition/MealEditor.tsx` - Food list editor
- `components/nutrition/FoodSearchV2.tsx` - Add more foods
- `lib/api/meals.ts` - createMeal API

**Features:**
- ✅ Pre-filled meal type, notes, and foods from scan
- ✅ Edit quantities and units
- ✅ Add more foods via search
- ✅ Remove foods
- ✅ Edit meal time
- ✅ Save to backend via `/api/v1/meals`

## Mobile-Specific Features

### ✅ Responsive Design
All pages use Tailwind responsive classes:
- `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- `flex-col` on mobile → `flex-row` on desktop
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44x44px)
- Proper spacing on small screens

### ✅ Camera Access
```tsx
// Uses HTML5 capture attribute for native camera
<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment" />
```

### ✅ Touch Gestures
- Swipe gestures not needed (button-based UI)
- Scroll works naturally
- Bottom navigation fixed and accessible

### ✅ Mobile Viewport
```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
viewport: {
  width: "device-width",
  initialScale: 1,
  maximumScale: 1,
  userScalable: false,
  viewportFit: "cover"
}
```

### ✅ PWA Support
- `manifest.json` includes meal scan shortcut
- Installable as app
- Works offline (with limitations)

## Testing Checklist

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test with non-food image (should show "No food detected")
- [ ] Test with poor quality image
- [ ] Test with no internet (should show error)
- [ ] Test food matching failure (should fallback gracefully)
- [ ] Test save failure (should show error, not crash)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ✅ Fixed
- Meal saving now works (removed item_type/template_id columns)
- Navigation links updated from /add to /log

### Potential Issues
1. **OpenAI API Rate Limits**
   - Client-side API calls can be rate limited
   - Consider moving to server-side if needed

2. **Large Images**
   - 10MB limit might be too large for slow connections
   - Consider image compression before upload

3. **Food Matching Accuracy**
   - Fuzzy matching may not always find exact matches
   - User can manually search and add if needed

4. **Offline Mode**
   - AI analysis requires internet
   - Can't work fully offline (by design)

## Backend Requirements

### Required Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/foods/match-detected` - Match detected foods to database
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/meals` - Create meal log
- ✅ Unified coach endpoints for streaming

### Database Tables
- ✅ `foods_enhanced` - Food database with nutrition
- ✅ `meal_logs` - Meal records
- ✅ `meal_foods` - Foods in meals (relational)

## Success Metrics
1. ✅ Camera opens on mobile
2. ✅ Image uploads successfully
3. ✅ AI detects foods correctly (>80% accuracy)
4. ✅ Foods match to database (>60% match rate)
5. ✅ User can edit and save meal
6. ✅ Meal appears in nutrition dashboard

## Next Steps
1. Test on real devices (iOS & Android)
2. Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
3. Gather user feedback on accuracy
4. Consider adding confidence scores to matches
5. Add ability to manually select from multiple matches
