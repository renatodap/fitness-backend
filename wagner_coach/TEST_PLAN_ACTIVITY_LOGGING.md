## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. Exercise drag-and-drop reordering not yet implemented (UI has grip icon but no functionality)
2. Auto-calculation of total_sets, total_reps, total_weight_lifted from exercises not implemented (backend can calculate)
3. No autocomplete for exercise names yet
4. No exercise history/suggestions from past workouts

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add exercise search/autocomplete from exercise database
2. Show previous performance for same exercise (last weight, reps)
3. Rest timer between sets
4. Progressive overload suggestions
5. Exercise form videos/instructions
6. Superset/circuit support
7. Export workout as PDF/share

## Contact for Issues

If any test fails, document:
1. Which test scenario
2. Expected vs actual result
3. Browser console errors
4. Network tab (if API error)
5. Screenshots if visual issue

Then report to development team with full details.
