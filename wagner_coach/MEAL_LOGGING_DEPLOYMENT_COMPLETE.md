## 🚀 Ready to Test

### Step 1: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd wagner-coach-backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend

```bash
cd wagner-coach-clean
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
- ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Test Food Search

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/nutrition/log`
2. Type "chicken" in the food search
3. ✅ Should see results from database (Chicken Breast, Chicken Thighs, etc.)

### Step 4: Test AI Coach Meal Preview

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/coach`
2. Type: "I had 6oz chicken breast and 1 cup rice for lunch"
3. ✅ AI should detect it as a meal
4. ✅ Preview should show same UI as manual logging
5. ✅ Edit and save

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (JSONB Schema) ❌
```sql
meal_logs
├── id
├── foods (JSONB array)     ❌ Denormalized
├── total_calories          ❌ Manual calculation
└── ...
```

**Problems**:
- No foreign key constraints
- Manual nutrition totals (error-prone)
- Can't query "all meals with chicken"
- No atomic updates

### After (Relational Schema) ✅
```sql
meal_logs                        meal_foods                    foods_enhanced
├── id ─────────────────────────┬─ meal_log_id                ├── id (70+ foods)
├── total_calories (auto)  ←────┼─ calories (cached)         ├── name
├── total_protein_g (auto) ←────┼─ protein_g (cached)        ├── brand_name
└── ...                         └─ ...                        └── ... (60+ nutrients)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ Auto-calculated totals via database triggers
- ✅ Can query "all meals with chicken"
- ✅ Atomic operations
- ✅ Cached nutrition for performance

## 🔧 Architecture

### How It Works Now

**1. User Searches for Food**
```
Frontend → GET /api/v1/foods/search?q=chicken
         ← Returns foods from foods_enhanced table
```

**2. User Creates Meal**
```
Frontend → POST /api/v1/meals
           {foods: [{food_id: "uuid", quantity: 200, unit: "g"}]}

Backend  → 1. Creates meal_log (totals = 0)
           2. Inserts into meal_foods table
           3. Database triggers auto-calculate totals
           4. Returns meal with calculated totals ✨
```

**3. Data Flow**
```
User Input → API Validation → meal_logging_service_v2
                            ↓
                    1. Insert meal_log
                    2. Insert meal_foods
                    3. Trigger calculates totals ✨
                    4. Return updated meal
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Backend API Tests
- [ ] `/api/v1/foods/search?q=chicken` returns 70+ seeded foods
- [ ] `/api/v1/foods/recent` returns empty array (no meals logged yet)
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/meals` creates meal with foods
- [ ] Meal totals are auto-calculated correctly
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/meals/{id}` returns meal with foods
- [ ] `PATCH /api/v1/meals/{id}` updates meal and recalculates totals
- [ ] `DELETE /api/v1/meals/{id}` deletes meal and cascade-deletes meal_foods

### Frontend Integration Tests
- [ ] Manual meal logging page food search works
- [ ] Can add multiple foods to a meal
- [ ] Totals display correctly
- [ ] Can save meal
- [ ] AI coach detects meals in messages
- [ ] Coach meal preview shows same UI as manual logging
- [ ] Can edit foods in coach preview
- [ ] Can save meal from coach preview
- [ ] Meals appear in nutrition dashboard

### Database Verification
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foods_enhanced` returns ~70
- [ ] `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meal_foods` increases when meals logged
- [ ] Triggers exist: `pg_trigger` table has meal_foods triggers
- [ ] RLS policies work: Users can only see their own meals

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd wagner-coach-backend
poetry install

# Check .env file exists
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, etc.

# Start server
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Food Search Returns Empty
- Verify migration 008 ran: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foods_enhanced;` (should be ~70)
- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Verify JWT token is valid

### Meal Creation Fails
- Get valid food IDs from `/api/v1/foods/search`
- Check request body matches schema (food_id, quantity, unit)
- Verify backend logs for detailed error

### Frontend Not Connecting
- Backend must be running on port 8000
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Verify CORS settings in backend
