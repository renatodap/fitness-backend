# Backend Testing Guide - Meal Logging with Relational Schema

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: ‚úÖ Migrations Complete | ‚úÖ Backend Updated | ‚è≥ Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Migrations (Run on Supabase)
‚úÖ **Migration 007**: Created `meal_foods` relational table with triggers
‚úÖ **Migration 008**: Seeded 70+ common foods with complete nutrition
‚úÖ **Migration 009**: Added helper functions and indexes

**Result**: Database now uses proper many-to-many relationship instead of JSONB denormalization.

### 2. Backend Service Updates
‚úÖ **food_search_service.py**: Updated to query `meal_foods` table with JOIN
‚úÖ **meals.py API**: Switched to `meal_logging_service_v2`
‚úÖ **Committed & Pushed**: Changes in Git (commit `94e5fa0`)

**Result**: Backend now uses relational schema with auto-calculated nutrition totals via triggers.

## üöÄ Next Steps: Testing

### Step 1: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd wagner-coach-backend

# Ensure .env has all required variables:
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (etc.)

# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Expected Output**:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

If you see errors about missing modules, install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

### Step 2: Test Food Search Endpoints

#### Get Your JWT Token

**Option A**: From Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Click on your test user
3. Copy the JWT token from "User JWT"

**Option B**: From Frontend Console
1. Open your frontend in browser
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Run: `localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')`
4. Copy the access_token value

#### Test Search Foods

```bash
# Replace YOUR_JWT_TOKEN with actual token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/foods/search?q=chicken&limit=10"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "foods": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Chicken Breast, Grilled, Skinless",
      "brand_name": null,
      "food_group": "Protein",
      "serving_size": 100,
      "serving_unit": "g",
      "calories": 165,
      "protein_g": 31,
      "carbs_g": 0,
      "fat_g": 3.6,
      "fiber_g": 0,
      "sugar_g": 0,
      "sodium_mg": 74,
      "is_recent": false,
      "is_generic": true
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 5,
  "limit": 10,
  "query": "chicken"
}
```

#### Test Recent Foods

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/foods/recent?limit=10"
```

**Expected Response** (if you have logged meals before):
```json
{
  "foods": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Chicken Breast, Grilled, Skinless",
      "last_quantity": 200,
      "last_unit": "g",
      "last_logged_at": "2025-10-06T12:30:00Z",
      "log_count": 5,
      "is_recent": true,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

If you haven't logged meals yet, this will return `{"foods": []}`.

---

### Step 3: Test Meal Logging Flow

#### Create a Meal

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Chicken and Rice Bowl",
    "category": "lunch",
    "logged_at": "2025-10-07T12:30:00Z",
    "notes": "Post-workout meal",
    "foods": [
      {
        "food_id": "CHICKEN_BREAST_UUID",
        "quantity": 200,
        "unit": "g"
      },
      {
        "food_id": "BROWN_RICE_UUID",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unit": "cup"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**How to Get Food UUIDs**:
1. First search for foods: `/api/v1/foods/search?q=chicken`
2. Copy the `id` field from the response
3. Use those UUIDs in the create meal request

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "id": "meal-uuid",
  "user_id": "your-user-id",
  "name": "Chicken and Rice Bowl",
  "category": "lunch",
  "logged_at": "2025-10-07T12:30:00Z",
  "notes": "Post-workout meal",
  "total_calories": 495,  // Auto-calculated by trigger!
  "total_protein_g": 39,   // Auto-calculated by trigger!
  "total_carbs_g": 45,     // Auto-calculated by trigger!
  "total_fat_g": 7.2,      // Auto-calculated by trigger!
  "foods": [
    {
      "food_id": "uuid",
      "name": "Chicken Breast, Grilled, Skinless",
      "quantity": 200,
      "unit": "g",
      "calories": 330,
      ...
    },
    {
      "food_id": "uuid",
      "name": "Brown Rice, Cooked",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit": "cup",
      "calories": 165,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "source": "manual",
  "created_at": "2025-10-07T12:35:00Z"
}
```

#### Get Meal by ID

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meals/MEAL_UUID"
```

#### Get All User Meals

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meals?limit=20"
```

#### Update Meal

```bash
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meals/MEAL_UUID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notes": "Updated notes",
    "foods": [
      {
        "food_id": "CHICKEN_BREAST_UUID",
        "quantity": 250,
        "unit": "g"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected**: Totals recalculated automatically.

#### Delete Meal

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meals/MEAL_UUID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 204 No Content (success)

### Step 4: Test Frontend Integration

Once backend is running on `localhost:8000`:

1. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd wagner-coach-clean
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Meal Logging**:
   - Go to `/nutrition/log`
   - Search for "chicken" in the food search
   - Should see results from database

3. **Test AI Coach Meal Preview**:
   - Go to `/coach`
   - Type: "I had 6oz chicken breast and 1 cup rice for lunch"
   - AI should detect it as a meal
   - Preview should show the same UI as manual logging
   - Edit and save

4. **Verify Data**:
   - Check `/nutrition` dashboard
   - Should see logged meals
   - Totals should be accurate

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`
```bash
cd wagner-coach-backend
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Error**: `SUPABASE_URL environment variable not set`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in all required environment variables

### Food Search Returns Empty

**Check**: Did migration 008 seed the foods?
```sql
-- Run on Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foods_enhanced;
-- Should return ~70
```

**Check**: Is JWT token valid?
```bash
# Decode JWT to see expiration
echo "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" | jwt decode -
```

### Meal Creation Fails

**Error**: `Food with ID 'xyz' not found`
- Use `/api/v1/foods/search` to get valid food IDs
- Copy the `id` field from search results

**Error**: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`
- You might be trying to add the same food twice to one meal
- The schema has `UNIQUE(meal_log_id, food_id)`

### Totals Not Calculating

**Check**: Are triggers enabled?
```sql
-- Run on Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname LIKE '%meal_foods%';
-- Should see 3 triggers
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Backend starts without errors
2. ‚úÖ `/api/v1/foods/search?q=chicken` returns foods from database
3. ‚úÖ Can create a meal with multiple foods
4. ‚úÖ Meal totals are auto-calculated correctly
5. ‚úÖ Frontend food search shows database results
6. ‚úÖ AI coach meal preview uses same UI as manual logging
7. ‚úÖ Can save meal from coach preview
8. ‚úÖ Meals appear in nutrition dashboard

---

## üìä Database Verification

### Check Schema Status

```sql
-- Run on Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Check meal_foods table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meal_foods;

-- 2. Check foods seeded
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foods_enhanced;
-- Should be ~70

-- 3. Check triggers exist
SELECT tgname, tgtype FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgrelid = 'meal_foods'::regclass;

-- 4. Check helper functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname IN (
  'get_meal_with_foods',
  'calculate_food_nutrition',
  'update_daily_nutrition_summary'
);

-- 5. Test a food search
SELECT id, name, calories, protein_g
FROM foods_enhanced
WHERE name ILIKE '%chicken%'
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## üéâ What's Changed

### Old Schema (JSONB) ‚ùå
```
meal_logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foods (JSONB array)  ‚ùå Denormalized
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ total_calories (manual sum)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Problems**:
- No foreign keys
- Manual totals (prone to errors)
- Can't query "all meals with chicken"

### New Schema (Relational) ‚úÖ
```
meal_logs                        meal_foods                    foods_enhanced
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ meal_log_id                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ total_calories (auto)  ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ calories (cached)         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ name
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                         ‚îî‚îÄ ...                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints
- ‚úÖ Auto-calculated totals (triggers)
- ‚úÖ Can query by food type
- ‚úÖ Atomic operations
